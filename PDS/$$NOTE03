Dear Sam,

I hope that you are in good health.

I would like to ask you the following favor:

I would like to replace the present FILE985
(File # 985 REXX execs from Marius Lewin)
with the replacement file that I join.

I added the following rexx execs:

editload    a rexx to edit a load module/program object by
                       accessing a IEBCOPY unloaded copy with
                       RECFM=VB and not VBS.
viewload    a rexx to execute an edit macro on a load
                       module/program object.
editxmit    a rexx to edit a load module/program object by
                       accessing a XMITted copy.
july        a rexx to convert from a Julian date to a Gregorian
                       date or reverse.
lk          a rexx to give the  linkedit/bind date of a load
                       module/program object
TOPDSE      a JCL example to copy a PDS or a PDSE to a PDSE
                      changing optionnally the primary and
                      secondary allocations.
COBOLCK     a rexx which gives the main characteristics of a
                      COBOL source program.
SOURCE      a rexx which extracts the COBOL source from a program
                      object of a COBOL program compiled with
                       TEST(DWARF,SOURCE).


 The original source PDS was XMITed and downloaded in binary by FTP.
 The XMIted file contains a $$README summary member and an
 acknowledgment member named ACK.

 I join the XMITed file.

 I thank you for making my rexx execs available on cbttape.org.

 All the best of everything to you and your family.
